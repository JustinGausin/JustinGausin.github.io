##In the moment of building and editing this page....


WannaCry is a ransomware that encrypts a victimâ€™s machine, specifically targeting the Windows Operating System. The coordinated attack in May 2017 targeted vulnerable Windows around the world and encrypted thousands of workstations. The only solution to decrypt the files, which was not guaranteed, was to pay using Bitcoin due to its nature of anonymity. The malware specifically targeted unsupported versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 7. The exploit of EternalBlue, the backbone vulnerability of the WannaCry malware, was discovered by the NSA. It was privately disclosed but was leaked to the ShadowBrokers, an underground marketplace for vulnerabilities and exploits. It is hard to trace a single block to a user unless the user discloses it using their E-Wallet. While ransomware combined with Bitcoin created a challenge for tracing the attack, the preliminary testing showed that the attack originated from North Korea. The additional investigation revealed that the attack is highly suspected to be the infamous Lazarus group from North Korea.

## Packed

It is common for malware to be packed to avoid firewall detection and reverse engineering analysis. Packing is a subset of obfuscation to make the file more difficult to analyze through encryption, compression, or both. A part of the packed program is a stub, a small portion of the code containing the decryption or decompression agent used on the packed file.  In most instances, the packaging tool used by the program are commercially or open-sourced available, but custom made packers can be used. 
To analyze if the WannaCry ransomware is packed, we use Krypt ANAlyzer(KANAL) in PEiD.

As shown above, the malware is not packed, but it was created using Microsoft Visual C++.
