## In the moment of building and editing this page....


WannaCry is a ransomware that encrypts a victim’s machine, specifically targeting the Windows Operating System. The coordinated attack in May 2017 targeted vulnerable Windows around the world and encrypted thousands of workstations. The only solution to decrypt the files, which was not guaranteed, was to pay using Bitcoin due to its nature of anonymity. The malware specifically targeted unsupported versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 7. The exploit of EternalBlue, the backbone vulnerability of the WannaCry malware, was discovered by the NSA. It was privately disclosed but was leaked to the ShadowBrokers, an underground marketplace for vulnerabilities and exploits. It is hard to trace a single block to a user unless the user discloses it using their E-Wallet. While ransomware combined with Bitcoin created a challenge for tracing the attack, the preliminary testing showed that the attack originated from North Korea. The additional investigation revealed that the attack is highly suspected to be the infamous Lazarus group from North Korea. 

We begin the investigation using static analysis.
## STATIC ANALYSIS

### Packed

It is common for malware to be packed to avoid firewall detection and reverse engineering analysis. Packing is a subset of obfuscation to make the file more difficult to analyze through encryption, compression, or both. A part of the packed program is a stub, a small portion of the code containing the decryption or decompression agent used on the packed file.  In most instances, the packaging tool used by the program are commercially or open-sourced available, but custom made packers can be used. 
To analyze if the WannaCry ransomware is packed, we use Krypt ANAlyzer(KANAL) in PEiD. 

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_2.png){: .align-center}


As shown above, the malware is not packed, but it was created using Microsoft Visual C++. 

We see quite a bit of cryptosystem being used in the program, see figure below. The first one is Adler32, a checksum to detect errors during transmission. Another checksum program is CRC32, which offers the same functionality as Adler32 but is more popularly used. CryptEncrypt and CryptDecrypt are two functions that work mutually; if the file is encrypted with CryptEncrypt, the decrypt API must be called (CryptDecrypt). Towards the bottom of the list, we can see Rijndael's cryptosystem, or what is commonly referred to as the AES cryptosystem. AES is a ubiquitous cryptosystem due to its robustness against decryption techniques. Lastly, the Zip is easy to describe as the zip extension. 

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_3.png){: .align-center}



From the imports, our guess is that the program is using *startservice*. Let us jump to sub_401F5D. We see:

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Wanna1.png){: .align-center}

We see a hard-code **.exe** file name, which could be a duplicate of the ransomware in the system. Let's jump into **sub_401CE8**, and look into the funtion calls:

<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_6.png"><img src="/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_6.png"></a>
    <a href="/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_7.png"><img src="/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_7.png"></a>
    <figcaption>lpDisplayName and lpServiceName are initialized using the ESI </figcaption>
</figure>


When using any service or API, the required parameters must be initialized or passed. In most instances of regular programs, the service parameters are hardcoded. However, we can see above that both the parameters *lpDisplayName* and *lpServiceName* are initialized using the ESI (the ESI register, a pointer type register). Hence, the name is not hardcoded but is passed by a *pointer*. We can only know the name of the service using the dynamic analysis (running the malware). Even in the OpenService, the service Name is still relatively hidden. 



### Mutex

A mutex is a unique identifier to a program. A mutex is designed to allow only one program with the given mutex to run its processes and child threads and avoiding race conditions. It’s a locking mechanism to protect resources from being visited twice or in a racing manner. Mutex allows the program to operate normally, and in a malware sense, it avoids competing with a copy of itself for the resources. 
 ![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_8.png){: .align-center}

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191107_9.png){: .align-center}

For the malware, we can find its mutex by proceeding into the **sub_401EFF** function. It is easy to assume that the mutex is Global\MsWinZoneCacheCounterMutexA, but there is a padded 0 at the end. Using *sprintf* and *push offset aSD*, the program concatenates the strings Global\xx with the variable 0, as shown above. 



## DYNAMIC ANALYSIS - Debugger

### Unique identifier
Now let us go to ***WinMain(x,x,x,x)***, and go into the function **call  sub_401225**.  We can see a function call (malware signature) and also some random number generations (e.g. seed). First, we will use an advanced feature in IDAPro called Win32 debugger; Select *Debugger*->*Local Win32 debugger*, and then set a breakpoint before **call  sub_401225**.
Next, we go into **sub_401225** and press **F5** to change into pseudocode, which will make it easier for us to analyze. As shown below, we can recognize some *if* and *do while* condition, and as well as a *srand* function. The srand (or the seed generator before rand() is called) is set to 1. When srand is set to 1, the rand function will result in the same output value each time. 
![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191111_10.png){: .align-center}

Set a breakpoint at **0x0040202F**, as shown below. If we examine the  EAX in the general register, it should have the address: *0x0040F8AC*.  A unique string of values can be seen in the following address. Putting it all together, this shows that the srand(1) will produce the same output in all machines, thus creating a “static” naming state in the machines called **rfoufmcqgjq199**.
![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191111_13.png){: .align-center}

<br>

Further in our investigation, we face a conditional branch here: 

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Wanna5.png){: .align-center}


We can suspect that this may be a secret command line start-up. It seems the program is comparing the argument with 2 before the conditional branch is set up. If *no*, it will take the left branch; if *yes, it will take the right branch. If we run the program to the  **jnz short loc_40208E**, we will get the following result: 

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191113_14.png){: .align-center}

The green arrow points to the location of **0040208E**, meaning we did not go into the correct branch of operation. 

<br>
Let us redo the dynamic analysis, but in this case, we put the proper argument as the parameter.  Using *Debugger*->*Process Options*, we set up the *Parameters* to be "/i", as seen on the *push offset al      :"/i"* assembly code on our conditional branch (two images above). 

When we run the malware again with the correct parameters, we can see that we arrive at the right branch. We run the program until the code **.text 00402057 call sub_401B5F**, and view inside **sub_401B5F**. We can see some PathName such as C:\ProgramData, etc. We can guess that it creates something inside these folders. Now let us *F8* through **sub_401B5F**, and then go to *C:\Intel or ProgramData*, if the folder exists, using File Explorer. We will see that the new folder that was created and the folder name should be the unique identifier we found earlier (**rfoufmcqgjq199**).


### Hidden Folder 

After running **sub_401B5F** we can see that there was a folder being created inside *c:\ Intel folder*. By examining the folder, we can see the executable *tasksche.exe* inside the folder; presumably, the executable that runs the malware. 

If the folder inside ProgramData or Intel is hidden, we can change the File Explorer settings to show hidden files and folders. 

How is it possible to write hidden files?
When creating a file, we usually have to set the file attributes and the file name first. To create a hidden file, we must specify it under the *dwFileAttributes* parameter. For example, a *0x02* input would set the file to be hidden. 
![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Snip20191113_18.png){: .align-center}

### Service Name
We previously found that  *lpDisplayName* and *lpServicename* (and at the *.data:DisplayName*) are pointing to the address of the following string **rfoufmcqgjq199**. Additionally, the folder name where taskche.exe is stored is called the **rfoufmcqgjq199** folder under Intel. To prove our speculation on the service name, we need to examine the running services after running WannaCry. As shown below, we can see the malware service at the list of Services:

## STATIC ANALYSIS Part 2
Let us stop the debugging process and continue our static analysis:

#### insert image here Wanna_X

For this part, we will examine **call sub_401F5D**. Let us rename it *StartWannacry* since if we run the function call, the malware will infect our VM completely. Before running the function, make sure to have a clean Snapshot of the VM. Now let us run to cursor at **.text:0040207F  jz short loc_40208E”**,  a line before *StartWannacry*. Then we will see a file called *tasksche.exe* being dropped inside the folder created previously (-------). The file is just another copy of the WannaCry Ransomware we are currently investigating (Recall that computer worms create copies of themselves to expose more victims). 


Let’s proceed with our analysis in the static analysis by restoring to the previous clean snapshot.
After “SetCurrentDirectoryA”, we see a function call “sub_4010FD”, which has the following pseudocode: 



By using the tool RegShot before and after the instruction calls, we will notice that the malware is trying to create a registry entry under **HKLM\Software** as **Wannacry0r**. The function **call sub_4010FD** is designed is to create a service for the persistence of the taskche.exe in the system. 

#### insert image

We see can instruction ahead **call sub_4010FD** with the string WNcry@2ol7, which is passed to the function **call sub_401DAB**. The function is quite complex, but to my general knowledge, it is loading a Resource module called XIA. It compares if one of the loaded modules is called c.wncry in a while loop. p


Let us assume that **WNcry@2ol7** is a hard-coded password used to unzip the resources (recall this is ransomware). Let us confirm this by using the tool *ResourceHacker* to open WannaCry and save it as a Zip file. If we unzip this the resource will be released (even if we receive a warning that says your password is incorrect). By opening the */wcry* folder, there should be two .exe files, several *.wnry* files, and a *msg* folder.  The malware authors may have zipped the resources to avoid firewall detection due to its sheer size

![image-center](/assets/images/WannaCry/Wanna9.png){: .align-center}


The message folder contains the infamous “Warning Message” in different languages, which WannaCry posts detailing that all the files have been encrypted.

</figure>


### Bitcoins 

Let's move into **sub_401E9E**. We see a combination of a hard-coded hash string and a rand number 3. These peculiar hashes are the attacker’s Bitcoin address and the program will randomly choose one Bitcoin address among the 3. If we use www.blockchain.com or other blockchain websites to trace the number of transactions and the money received by those Bitcoin addresses, we can observe the balances accumulated by each account. About 54.44 BTC were paid, assuming the malware authors accumulated all the bitcoins and sold them around Dec. 2017 (shows that people paid for the ransom even if it was not guaranteed).

###  Hidden files again
We see a command line right before **sub_401064**:
#### insert image here
If we trace back our steps in this task with the XIA resource loading and the current directory being Software\WanaCrypt\wd. We may conclude that “attribute +h .” is a command-line command that hides the files inside this directory. The only way to see hidden files would be to set the current configuration to display hidden files (File Explorer) or under the command prompt, type the command “dir /A”. 


Next, we click into sub_401064. Now, let us retrace a bit, we have renamed **sub_401F5D** into *StartService*, and we identified that the malware wants to start itself as a service. By following the logic flow, we see that **sub_401064** is running in parallel with *StartService*; tasksche.exe is executed as command-line commands much like attribute +h and icalc.

After **sub_401064**, we see another function **sub_40170A**. Using the cross-reference tool, we can see it calls another function **sub_401A45**:
#### insert image here

From the keywords, we know that it focuses on cryptography. **Sub_401A45** generates the key that may be needed for encrypting a file. It calls the CryptAPI for Microsoft, which generates a key for encryption and decryption.

### DLL Decryption

Since there's no error when opening it on IDAPro, we can see from above that our DLL file is correct. The file holds various decryption functions, so it may be part of the malware that handles the decryption process.
