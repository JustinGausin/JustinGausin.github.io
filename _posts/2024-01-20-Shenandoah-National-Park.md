# Shenandoah National Park
Shenandoah National Park, located in the state of Virginia, is a breathtaking expanse of natural beauty that encompasses the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Established in 1935, the park covers over 200,000 acres and is renowned for its stunning vistas, dense forests, and diverse wildlife. Skyline Drive, a scenic highway that stretches for 105 miles along the park's spine, offers visitors panoramic views of the Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Piedmont region to the east. Hiking enthusiasts can explore a network of over 200 miles of trails, including a portion of the famous Appalachian Trail. The park is a haven for outdoor recreation, with opportunities for camping, birdwatching, and observing the vibrant fall foliage. Shenandoah National Park provides a serene escape into nature, allowing visitors to connect with the great outdoors and experience the tranquility of this protected wilderness.

Data was taken from USGS, and visualized using rayshader, following the work of [Spencer Schien](https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/).

Part of my motivation in this project is due to the many hikes I have done in the Shenandoah National Park. A few of these trails are visualized below. 

## McAfee Knob Trail

McAfee Knob, situated within Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, is a renowned and iconic landmark along the Appalachian Trail. This prominent rocky outcrop offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley. Hikers and nature enthusiasts are drawn to McAfee Knob for its stunning scenery and the rewarding hike it takes to reach the summit.

## Old Rag Trail 
Old Rag Trail is one of the most popular and challenging hikes in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. Renowned for its rugged terrain and stunning views, this 9.2-mile loop takes hikers on an exhilarating journey through rocky outcrops, dense forests, and exposed ridges. The highlight of the trail is the summit of Old Rag Mountain, which stands at 3,291 feet and provides unparalleled panoramic views of the surrounding landscapes.
